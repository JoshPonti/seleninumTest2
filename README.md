This project is solely for learning Selenium + JUnit and "de-rusting" my Java.

If you somehow come across this project in some way, I know it's not the cleanest. I'm trying to re-learn Java after not using it for about 6ish years.

This project uses the site https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ and automates navigating to each page contained within, completing the task on the page, and asserts a facet of the page such as inputs, outputs, and/or page elements.
The automation portion of this project is using Selenium + Java to automate the tasks then using JUnit to run assertion tests to run validations.
